# Day 4: remote repositories [20 min]

## Exercise 28

**Objectives:** learn how to work with remote repositories in a collaborative way.
This exercise is intended to be developed by pairs. At the end of the exercise you should have a landing page with at least this sections:
-   **header**  - wraps your page header;
-   **footer**  - wraps your page footer;
-   **section**  - groups content into sections (e.g. main area, sidebar etc);
-   **article**  - separates the individual articles from the rest of the page;
-   **nav**  - contains your navigation menu

1. One of the members of the team should create a public remote repository and called `pairs_landing_page`.
2. Add your teammate as a collaborator.
3. Each one should clone the repository in his own device.
4. Each section should be deployed in a feature branch and not in the  `master` or `main` branch.
5. Each member of the group would be in charge of one of the sections.
6. After a section is finished merge those changes into the `main` branch.
7. Once the page is done publish it in github pages.
8. In the forum share the web page link and the repository link. The repository should have the `main` branch and each one of the features branches.
