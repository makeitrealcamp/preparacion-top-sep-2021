**Objective:** learn how to work with JS using NodeJS.

## Exercise 30

1. Write a program that prompts the user for a number and prints to the console if the number is greater or less than / equal to 10. If it is greater, you must print "The number is greater than 10". If it is less, you must print "The number is less than or equal to 10". Share your answer in this link.
2. Write a program that randomly thinks of a number from 1 to 10 and asks the user to try to guess it. If the number is correct it should print "Congratulations, that was it!" On the console, otherwise it should print "Sorry, try again!" Share your answer in this link.
3. A multiple of 5 is one that divided by 5 results in a whole number (no remainder). For example 10, 15, 20, etc. they are multiples of 5. 11 is not a multiple of 5 because there would be a remainder of 1.
Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints if it is a multiple of 5 or not. If it is a multiple, it must print "Yes, the number x is a multiple of 5", otherwise it must print "No, the number x is not a multiple of 5". Share your answer in this link.
4. Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints to the console if the number is greater than, less than or equal to 10. If the number is less than 10 you must print "The number is less than 10". If the number is greater than 10 you must print "The number is greater than 10". If the number is equal to 10 you must print "The number is equal to 10".
5. Modify  the `calculate BMI`, and asks the user for height and weight.
