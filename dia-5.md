## Exercise 29

1. Write a program who prints all numbers from 0 to 10
2. Write a program to calculate the area of a triangle, a square and a rectangle
3. BMI is a personâ€™s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI can indicate high body fatness.
To calculate BMI, see the [Adult BMI Calculator](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html) or determine BMI by finding your height and weight in this [BMI Index Chartexternal icon](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi_tbl.htm).
-   If your BMI is less than 18.5, it falls within the underweight range.
-   If your BMI is 18.5 to <25, it falls within the healthy weight range.
-   If your BMI is 25.0 to <30, it falls within the overweight range.
-   If your BMI is 30.0 or higher, it falls within the obesity range.
Write a program that for a `height` and `weight `  calculates the BMI and prompt what category of obesity the person is.
